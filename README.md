# NanoSteps



## How to run the app after your download the code from git

1. Open the project files in Xcode and create a new SwiftUI App project.
2. Add these source files to the project (copy into the project folder or add them in Xcode).
3. Set your OpenAI API key (Need to purchased from OpenAI through a subscription):
   - replace `APIKey.swift` placeholder value. 
   - It is not required to have the OpenAI API key to run the app. Without the key, app will respond with default values.
4. Build and Run on a simulator or device.

Notes:
- No backend required. All data stored locally via UserDefaults.
- Colors use system colors and programmatic ultramarine-like shades; you can add color assets if desired.
